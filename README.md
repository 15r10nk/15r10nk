## About me üëã

I'm a software developer. My goal with my opensource work is to help other people to develop better software faster.

My main projects are:

### [inline-snapshot](https://github.com/15r10nk/inline-snapshot)

Allows you to write
```python
def test_addition()
    assert 5+5==snapshot()
```
and to change the snapshot to  `snapshot(10)` when you run `pytest --inline-snapshot=create`

### [pysource-minimize](https://github.com/15r10nk/pysource-minimize)

Helps you to find bugs by minimizing python source files to the minimal amount of code which is necessary to reproduce the bug


### [pysource-codegen](https://github.com/15r10nk/pysource-codegen)

Generates random python code, which is useful to test linter, formatter or other tools which work with python code.

### [codecrumbs](https://github.com/15r10nk/codecrumbs)

Codecrumbs can be used to refactor code across space üöÄ and time ‚è∞.
The idea is to annotate your python code with decorators which describe deprecations.
These refactoring can then be applied by some one else in some other project which uses your library.

## Sponsors ‚ù§Ô∏è

[Sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/15r10nk) allows me to invest more time in my open source projects.
I have no special insider features at the moment, but I plan to add some to my projects in the future.
